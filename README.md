Project name: Project 1 Python with DigitalSkola

DigitalSkola is an education platform that provides online course Bootcamp for anyone who wants to learn something new and upgrade their skill, mainly in the digital world.

One of the Bootcamp courses in Digital Skola is Data Engineer, which I joined now.

In this session, the student course learns to apply what they learned about Python, do the live coding with the expert and upload it to the GitHub platform.

The project goals are to make a monthly report from the data which has been given and share to slack platform.

What I have learned from this project :
  1. How to add excel files report into Visual Data Studio (the tool I run the Python)
  2. How to use Slack and its benefit in data reporting
  3. How to transform tables data report into graphics and directly report to Slack channel

As I am still a beginner in this coding area, I would like some insight to make a better report that can be useful to anyone who reads.
Happy reading!
