Project name : Project 1 Python with DigitalSkola
DigitalSkola is a education platform who provide online course bootcamp for anyone who wants to learn something new and upgrade their skill mostly in digital world.
One of the bootcamp course in Digital Skola is Data Engineer, which I joined at this current time.
In this session, the student course learn to apply what they learned about Python, and doing the live coding with the expert and upload it at github platform.
The project goals are to made a monthly report from the data which has been given and share to slack platform.
What I have learned from this project :
  1. How to add excel files report into Visual Data Studio (the tool I run the Python)
  2. How to use Slack and its benefit in data reporting
  3. How to transform tables data report into graphic and directly reporting to Slack channel
As I am still the very beginner in this coding area, feel free if there is some insight so I can make a better report and can be useful to anyeone who read.
Happy reading!
